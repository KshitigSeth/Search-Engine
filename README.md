# Search Engine Project

A Python-based search engine that indexes and searches academic papers from ArXiv. This project automates downloading papers in PDF format from ArXiv, preprocesses them (tokenization, stop word removal, and stemming), builds an inverted index with TF-IDF scoring for relevance ranking (along with exact phrase matching), and provides a search interface to retrieve relevant documents based on keyword or phrase queries.
